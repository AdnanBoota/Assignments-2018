#  Tasks for Lab session #1
## Task 1.1:
Install Python on your laptop.

For these lab sessions we advice you to create a new anaconda environment using the bare minimum amount of Python packages. You will be adding more packages as you need them later.

Once the new environment is set you can hover and see the path where the python interpreter and the packages have been installed.

You can also open a terminal and examine your new environment.

Using the Anaconda terminal, some unix commands also work in MS-Windows:

```bash
(CCBDA_UPC) C:\prompt> which python
/cygdrive/c/Anaconda/envs/CCBDA_UPC/python
```

That answer means that your python interpreter is at `c:\Anaconda\envs\CCBDA_UPC\python`. You will get a similar response if you are using a unix OS.

If you need to use the commands from that new environment you must make sure that the `PATH` variable (both windows and unix) contains the directory. To update that variable for windows. If your environment has a different name or it has been created in a different path change the command accordingly.

```bash
SET PATH=%PATH%;c:\Anaconda\envs\CCBDA_UPC;c:\Anaconda\envs\CCBDA_UPC\Scripts;
```

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a very popular [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) that will make your life much easier. It supports execution and debugging of Python, Python environments, code version control, it has a built-in terminal and all kinds of plugins. Moreover, it is [completely free for students](https://www.jetbrains.com/buy/classroom/?product=pycharm).



## Task 1.2:
Create a python code that uses the “random” library. We will positively value if you build a creative program in python. The minimum example accepted will be a code that generates a random number between 1 and 20. Then let the player guess the number introduced, displaying if the number is too low or high. The game ends either when the number is guessed correctly. The suggested program name is `Lab1.guessnumber.py`.

If you are using PyCharm try to become familiar with the integrated debugger. You will need to debug your code in future sessions. On the top-right part of the IDE:

<p align="center"><img src="./images/Lab01-PyCharmEditConfig.png " alt="Lab05-1" title="Edit configuration"/></p>

Create a new configuration to run each Python Script:

<p align="center"><img src="./images/Lab01-PyCharmDebugConfig.png " alt="Lab05-1" title="New configuration"/></p>

Just to become familiar with the IDE, set some break points and examine the variables.


## Task 1.3:
Create a `private repository` **CLOUD-COMPUTING-CLASS-2018** in your GitHub account. Use your student email account (".upc.edu") to create your GitHub account to benefit from private repositories and other perks of the [student pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

We advice you to create a global folder with a subfolder for each lab session similarly as shown below:

<p align="center"><img src="./images/SolutionsFolder.png " alt="Lab01-1" title="Solutions Folder"/></p>

## Task 1.4:
Update your remote repository from the local repository on your laptop:
```
echo "# CLOUD-COMPUTING-CLASS-2018" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git add Lab1/Lab1.guessnumber.py
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/CLOUD-COMPUTING-CLASS-2018.git
git push -u origin master
```
> change `<username>` for your Github account

It is better that you manage git by hand. Once you become familiar with git you can use PyCharm to save you some typing.

## Task 1.5:
Update the `README.md` file including all the information about your group (member's name and email addresses).
## Task 1.6:
Invite `angeltoribio-UPC-BCN` to your remote private repository as a collaborator using `settings` button (for evaluation purpose).
## Task 1.7:
Create an EC2 instance at AWS. Login and pull down all the contents of your GitHub repository to make an exact clone by using `git clone` command.
## Task 1.8:
Execute the program `Lab1.guessnumber.py` in your AWS instance. Take a screenshot of the terminal window that are you using as proof.
Include that screenshot in your local repository, on your laptop, with the name `Lab1.AWSterminal.png`.
## Task 1.9:
Update your remote GitHub repository with the updated `README.md`and the new file `Lab1.AWSterminal.png` using the `git`commands `add`, `commit` and `push`.
## Task 1.10:
Create an S3 bucket and synchronize your repository there. Take a screenshot of the browser window showing your S3 bucket. Include that screenshot in your local repository, on your laptop, with the name `Lab1.S3Bucket.png`.

# How to submit this assignment:
Submit **before the deadline** to the *RACO Practicals section* a "Lab1.txt" file including:

1. Group number
2. Name and email of the members of this group
3. GitHub URL that contains your lab answers
4. Add any comment that you consider necessary
